In this project, I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze BrandBoxâ€™s sales performance across regions, customers, product categories, and time periods. The process involved cleaning and transforming raw sales data using Power Query, creating a structured data model with appropriate relationships, and designing calculated measures in DAX for KPIs such as total sales, profit, quantity sold, and average order value. The dashboard revealed that Maharashtra generated the highest sales, while Electronics was the leading product category, contributing 46% of total units sold. Among customers, Harivansh accounted for the highest purchase volume. A notable insight was that Cash on Delivery (41%) remained the most preferred payment method, indicating potential areas to improve prepaid adoption. Additionally, profit trends showed a gradual decline from January to March, suggesting seasonal impact or marketing inefficiencies. High-profit sub-categories like Printers and Phones presented opportunities for targeted growth. This analysis provided actionable insights for business strategy, customer targeting, and payment optimization.
