This project involved creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to track and analyze sales data for BrandBox across different dimensions‚Äîstate, customer, product category, payment method, and time (month/quarter). The workflow included data cleaning in Power Query, building data models with proper relationships, and creating dynamic DAX measures to calculate key performance indicators such as Total Sales, Profit, Quantity, and AOV. The dashboard was designed to be fully interactive, enabling stakeholders to filter by time and category for deeper insights.
